# hello-world

The Beginning 

# Current college student that just finished my first semester (12 credit hours) in Information Systems. I highly enjoyed Networking and Security through Cisco's Network Academy. Although, my programming teacher is now trying to to pull me to the darkside, The Programming side. 

10 years ago, I left College early to pursue a career in sales where I quickly became an independent insurance broker. This year I decide to change careers to one I would love. So I decided to dive into the tech world. Spring of 2018 is when I decided to go back to school and find a local job that did not require travel. Since May, I have completed my Assoicates in Arts (1 Biology away from Associates in Science) and moved from Tech Supervisor to Sales Manager at my current job. This fall semester is my first in Infosys. After this past semester, I have now completed a total of 24 credit hours while holding a 4.0 which has put me on the President's List and accepted into the college's Leadership Academy (a top honor). I have greatly enjoy the little glimpse of programming from this past semester that I am heavily leaning towards a switch in focus. 


Cheers and Let's Create!!!
